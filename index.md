## Download G3D

You can download G3D here.

G3D is a revised variant of Godot made specifically for 3d. 2d capabilities are limited compared to the original Godot, you have been warned.

Some important features:

- Optimized 3d and better chunking capabilities
- MUCH better handling of large models, even without chunking
- GOOD VEHICLE PHYSICS!

This is mainly designed for my own game, but it might help to have it published.
